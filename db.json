The player who takes away all the opponent's stones or who has the last stone on the board, is considered as the winner.\n\nThe Shillong Teer Result also depends on certain factors such as luck, skills, and experience of the player.

Teer results for that game would refer to the numbers that are drawn on those particular days.\n\nTeer results can also be used to refer to other types of gambling games as well. For instance, if someone is playing a game of blackjack at a casino, the result of their hand could be considered teer results.
