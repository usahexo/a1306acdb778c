#  Can Neighbours In Roulette Help You Win?

 Neighbours in roulette are the five neighbouring numbers to the number you have placed your bet on. If you bet on a number, and one or more of its neighbours come up as winners, then your payout is typically multiplied by two, three or four. The idea behind this betting strategy is that because the neighbouring numbers are likely to come up also, your chances of winning are improved.

To put this into perspective, let’s imagine there are only eight red numbers on the roulette wheel. If you were to place a bet on red and one of its neighbours (e.g. 22), then it’s likely that one of these two numbers would come up as the winner. In this instance, your payout would be doubled (x2).

It’s important to remember that the odds of any particular number coming up are still the same, whether you bet on it directly or one of its neighbours. However, because there are more potential winners when betting on neighbours, your chances of winning are slightly improved.

#  What You Need To Know About Neighbours In Roulette

Neighbours in roulette are the numbers which are located on either side of the number you have bet on. For example, if you bet on number 23, then the neighbour numbers would be 22 and 24.

There are a few things that you need to know about neighbours in roulette. The first is that they can influence the outcome of the spin. If, for example, a lot of people have been betting on number 23, then the neighbouring numbers are going to be more likely to come up as they will have more attention drawn to them.

The second thing that you need to know about neighbours is that they can help you to win. This is because when you bet on a number and its neighbours come up, you will automatically receive half of your bet back. So, if you were to bet $10 on number 23 and its two neighbour numbers came up, then you would get back $5.

Ultimately, knowing about neighbours in roulette can help you to make better bets and increase your chances of winning money.
