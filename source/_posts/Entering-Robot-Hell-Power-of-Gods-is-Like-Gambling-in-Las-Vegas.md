With their flashing lights and deafening noises, casinos are all about creating a buzzy atmosphere that can quickly sweep you up in the excitement.

#  Will Gambling Take You to the Top of Robot Hell?

Robots have been making significant inroads into the workplace in recent years. They are now commonly used in manufacturing and logistics, and are increasingly being deployed in more cognitive roles such as customer service and finance.

Robots can be faster, more accurate and more consistent than humans, and this has led to concerns about their impact on employment. A recent study by Forrester predicted that automation will lead to the loss of over 7 million jobs in the US by 2025.

Many people view this trend with alarm, but there is another side to the story. Automation also creates opportunities for new types of jobs to be created. These new jobs are often higher skilled and pay better than the jobs that they replace.

Some observers have even suggested that gambling could be one of the key drivers of future job growth. The casino industry is already worth over $150 billion per year, and it is growing rapidly. It is expected to grow at an annual rate of 6% over the next five years, reaching a total value of $200 billion by 2022.

This presents a huge opportunity for those looking for work. The traditional casino industry is dominated by low-skill jobs such as dealers and croupiers. However, as the industry grows, it is increasingly looking for higher-skilled workers such as data scientists and marketing experts.

There are also opportunities for those with technical skills. For example, online casinos need programmers to design and maintain their websites, and mathematicians to develop new game algorithms. In fact, there is a demand for almost all types of skillset in the casino industry.

So if you are looking for a job that is both interesting and lucrative, then look no further than the casino industry!
