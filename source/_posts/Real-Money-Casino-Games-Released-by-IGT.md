#  Playing Casino Games with Real Money is now available in the UK

Although casino games have been enjoyed in the UK for many years, there was always one important thing missing – the chance to play with real money. This all changes today, as the UK Gambling Commission has given the green light for casinos to operate with real money.

While some may be concerned about the implications this could have on problem gambling rates, others are simply excited at the prospect of being able to win some serious cash. The first casinos to take advantage of this new ruling include Betfred, Paddy Power, and William Hill.

For those who love to play casino games such as roulette and blackjack, this is great news. Not only can you enjoy these thrilling games in the comfort of your own home, but you can also do so with the chance of winning big payouts. In fact, Paddy Power is offering starting amounts of £5 for its real money players, so there’s no need to worry about spending a lot of money upfront.

Of course, it’s important to remember that gambling can be addictive, so please gamble responsibly. If you feel like you’re struggling with your gambling habits, please seek help from one of the many organisations that cater to gambling addiction.

#  South African Players can now start playing for real money 

South Africa has been one of the last few holdouts for regulated online poker. But that changed this week when the country’s regulator, the National Gambling Board (NGB), authorized 888 Holdings and Sun International to offer real money online poker.

Players in South Africa have been able to play at offshore sites for some time, but with no legal protection if something goes wrong. The new regulations should give players more peace of mind, as well as attract new players to the market.

888 Holdings is one of the largest online gaming companies in the world. It operates casino and poker rooms in a number of countries, including Spain, Portugal, Italy and France. Sun International is a large casino operator in South Africa with resorts and casinos across the country.

Both companies are expected to launch their new poker offerings in South Africa soon. Details on what games will be offered and what limits will be put in place have not yet been released. However, both 888 Holdings and Sun International are likely to offer a wide range of games, including Texas Hold’em, Omaha and Stud.

It is not yet clear how much tax revenue the new regulations will generate for South Africa’s government. But with a population of over 50 million people and an increasing demand for online gaming products, it is likely to be a significant amount.
