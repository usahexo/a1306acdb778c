#  PokerStars Launches Genesis Casino - A Club for High Rollers

PokerStars, the world's largest online poker site, is about to get a little bit more exclusive. The company has just announced the launch of Genesis Casino, a new online casino that will only be open to high rollers.

According to PokerStars, Genesis Casino will offer "the ultimate gaming experience" for its members. This will include luxurious surroundings, high-quality games, and exclusive benefits and rewards.

To be eligible for membership in Genesis Casino, players must have deposited at least $5,000 at PokerStars in the past six months. They must also maintain a minimum PokerStars balance of $1,000.

Casino games represented on the new platform will include slots, roulette, blackjack, and baccarat. In addition to these classics, PokerStars says that Genesis Casino will also feature some "never-before-seen" games. These are likely to be exclusive titles that can only be found at Genesis Casino.

Exclusive benefits for Genesis members will include special bonuses, VIP events, and personalized support from a team of "dedicated casino hosts." Players will also be able to earn StarsCoin rewards which can be used to buy goods and services in the PokerStars Shop.

Commenting on the launch of Genesis Casino, Guy Templer, Chief Operating Officer of PokerStars said: “Our ambition is always to offer our customers the best possible experience and with Genesis Casino we believe we have created something truly unique that will appeal to our most discerning players."

He added: “We are confident that this new venture will further enhance our position as the number one choice for online casino gaming”.

The launch of Genesis Casino represents a major expansion for PokerStars into the online casino market. In recent years the company has been focusing increasingly on providing a comprehensive suite of gambling products beyond poker. This move into casinos seems to be paying off, as last year PokerStars reported record revenues of over $1 billion.

#  What Exactly Does Club On Mean In Poker?

A club is a symbol in poker that is used to indicate which card is being referred to. When playing five-card draw, for example, it can be helpful to place a club on the table face-up to remind all players which card you are talking about. Most often times, this will be the card that you are looking to replace in your hand.

If you are playing stud poker, clubs can also be used as part of your hole cards. This means that one of your down cards will be a club, and this can give you some additional information about the strength of your hand.

In addition to its use in specific variants of poker, clubs can also be handy when you are playing in a game with community cards. By placing a club next to the board, you can remind everyone which card is yours - and this can come in handy if there are any disputes at the table.
