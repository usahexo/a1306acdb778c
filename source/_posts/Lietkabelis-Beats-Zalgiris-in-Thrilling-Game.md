#  Late Surge Leads to Victory over Juventus 

For the first time in over three years, Tottenham Hotspur were able to achieve a comprehensive victory over Juventus. The last time that Spurs had bested the Italian powerhouse was back in February of 2016, when they won 3-1. This time around, Spurs found themselves down 2-0 early on but staged a late comeback to take all three points with a final score of 3-2.

The match got off to a quick start, as Juventus midfielder Miralem Pjanic netted from close range just six minutes in. Ten minutes later, the Bianconeri doubled their lead when Gonzalo Higuain finished off a well-worked team move. It looked as though Mauricio Pochettino’s side were going to suffer another disappointment against one of Europe’s top teams, but they showed great character to fight back.

In the 79th minute, Harry Kane pulled one back for Spurs with a well-taken header. Five minutes later, Christian Eriksen equalized with an equally impressive finish. And then, in the 88th minute, Dele Alli completed the comeback by scoring the winner with a superb strike from outside the penalty area.

This was an important win for Tottenham Hotspur and it keeps them in contention for a top-four finish in the Premier League. They now have 43 points from 24 games, which is just two points behind fourth-place Liverpool. Juventus, meanwhile, stay first in Serie A with 50 points from 21 games.
