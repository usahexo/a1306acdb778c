The Shillong Teer result is a lottery game that is played in the northeast Indian state of Meghalaya. The game is said to have originated from the Khasi people, who live in the state. The goal of the game is to guess the numbers that will be called out, and players can win up to Rs. 80,000 (around $1,200) if they guess all six numbers correctly. 

The game works like this: players purchase tickets with six randomly-chosen numbers between 0 and 99 printed on them. The ticket cost Rs. 10 (about $0.15). Once all tickets have been sold, a machine called a “Teer drum” is used to draw two rounds of numbers - the first round has four numbers, and the second round has two numbers. If your ticket matches at least one number from either rounds, then you win a prize! There are several different prize levels, and the amount you win depends on how many numbers on your ticket match the drawn numbers.
