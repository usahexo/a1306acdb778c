#  Penguins minus Capitals in Stanley Cup opener

The Penguins and Capitals open their Stanley Cup series tonight in Washington. The Penguins are minus their captain Sidney Crosby who is out with a concussion.

Pittsburgh is led by Evgeni Malkin and other high scorers Jordan Staal, James Neal and Chris Kunitz. Pittsburgh goalie Marc-Andre Fleury has been in good form, but the Capitals have more depth in scoring with Alexander Ovechkin, Nicklas Backstrom and Mike Knuble.

Washington goalie Michal Neuvirth has also been in good form but could be challenged by the Penguins scoring depth. Look for this series to go six or seven games with the Capitals finally lifting the Stanley Cup.

#  Dodgers still a minus-money bet to win the World Series

The Los Angeles Dodgers went into the season as heavy favorites to win their first World Series in 29 years. However, they have been a bit of a disappointment so far and are now only a minus-money bet to win the title.

The Dodgers were expected to be led by their powerful lineup, but they have been inconsistent at best. They currently rank just seventh in the National League in runs scored and have had to rely on strong pitching performances from Clayton Kershaw and others to stay afloat.

Their bullpen has also been a problem area, as they rank dead last in the NL with a 4.73 ERA. This could be a major issue if they face any strong teams in the playoffs.

On the other hand, the Houston Astros have been one of the best teams in baseball this year and currently have odds of plus-money to win the World Series. They are led by an explosive offense that ranks first in the league in runs scored and features stars like Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa.

Their pitching staff has also been strong, with Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole leading the way. Their bullpen has been shaky at times, but they appear to have enough firepower to overcome that weakness.

Overall, it looks like the Astros are a much better team than the Dodgers right now and should be considered the favorites to win it all.

#  Villanova a minus 1.5 point favorite over Michigan

The Wildcats, who lost in the finals to North Carolina last year, are a minus 1.5 point favorite over Michigan, according to sports betting site 5Dimes.

Villanova is coming off of a dominant performance in the East Region where they beat Radford, Alabama, West Virginia and Texas Tech by an average of nearly 23 points per game. They enter the Final Four as the number one overall seed in the tournament.

Michigan had a tougher road to the Final Four with wins over Montana, Houston, Texas A&M and Loyola-Chicago. The Wolverines are led by freshman forward Moritz Wagner who is averaging 14.6 points and 7.1 rebounds per game in the NCAA Tournament.

Villanova has won two of the three meetings against Michigan all-time, but the last meeting was in 2003.

#  Saints open as 3-point underdogs to Rams in NFC Championship rematch

The New Orleans Saints will open as 3-point underdogs to the Rams in the NFC Championship rematch according to the latest Las Vegas odds.

New Orleans stunned Los Angeles 26-23 in overtime back in January to advance to their first Super Bowl since 2009. The Rams are looking for revenge this time around, and they'll have home-field advantage after finishing with the best record in the NFC in 2018.

The Saints started slowly this season but turned things around down the stretch, winning seven of their last eight games. They're led by one of the NFL's top quarterbacks in Drew Brees, who is coming off a season where he threw for over 4,000 yards and 32 touchdowns.

Rodgers rushed for 149 yards and two touchdowns and added 119 yards receiving against LA earlier this season.

Los Angeles is led by MVP frontrunner Todd Gurley, who had 1,831 scrimmage yards and 21 touchdowns this season. He was held to just 78 total yards in the first meeting against New Orleans, but expect him to be a major factor on Sunday.

This should be another close game between these two teams, but the Rams are currently favored to win at home.

#  Rockets move to 4-point favorites over Warriors

The Houston Rockets were moved to 4-point favorites over the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday at the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook.

Houston is now a -4 favorite with an over/under of 224, up from Golden State being a 2.5-point favorite with an over/under of 227 when the odds opened early Wednesday morning.

“We just don’t think Steph Curry is going to play,” head oddsmaker Jeff Sherman said.

Curry, who is nursing a sprained ankle,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) is listed as doubtful for Game 3 on Thursday night in Houston. The two-time MVP has missed the past two games and the Warriors have gone 0-2 in that stretch.

Houston defeated Golden State 121-105 in Game 2 on Sunday to take a 2-0 series lead.
