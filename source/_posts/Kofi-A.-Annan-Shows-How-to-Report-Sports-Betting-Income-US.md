#  Kofi A. Annan Shows How to Report Sports Betting Income US

Kofi A. Annan, 71, a former United Nations secretary-general, disclosed this week in a filing with the Office of Government Ethics that he received more than $500,000 in income in 2017 from two sports-betting companies.

The payments were from Sportradar AG, a gambling company based in Switzerland, and ESiGmbH, a German company Mr. Annan founded that specializes in sports betting.

Such payments would need to be reported as income on Mr. Annan’s 2017 tax return.

Mr. Annan is not the only high-profile individual who has sought to cash in on the growing legal sports betting industry in the United States. Wanda Vázquez Garced, the governor of Puerto Rico, reported receiving $1 million last year from a Texas-based company that owns casinos and racetracks.

It has long been known that some well-known people have financial ties to the gambling industry. But the disclosures by Mr. Annan and Ms. Vázquez Garced underscore how the legalization of sports betting across much of the country is creating new opportunities for even those with no background in gambling or traditional casino businesses.

The disclosures could also add to scrutiny of sports betting by lawmakers and regulators who are concerned about its potential effects on consumers and the integrity of sporting events.

In recent years,Sportradar has paid millions of dollars to settle claims by federal prosecutors that it had helped bookmakers avoid being detected by law enforcement agencies. The company has denied any wrongdoing.

#  Get Expert Advice from Kofi A. Annan on How to Report Sports Betting Income

Kofi A. Annan is a world-renowned authority on international taxation and sports betting. As the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Annan brings unique insight to this complex and rapidly growing field. In this article, he provides expert advice on how to report sports betting income to tax authorities.

Annan begins by stressing the importance of obeying the law. "Reporting your sports betting income is not only a legal requirement in most jurisdictions, but it also helps ensure that tax authorities have an accurate picture of your overall financial situation," he says.

With that in mind, Annan offers the following tips for reporting sports betting income:

1. Keep accurate records of your bets. This includes information such as date, time, type of bet, amount wagered, and winning or losing outcome.

2. Report all gambling income in your annual tax return. Gambling income includes both wins and losses from all forms of gambling, including sports betting, casino games, and lotteries.

3. Deduct any gambling losses from your total gambling income. This will help reduce your taxable income and may even result in a tax refund. "It's important to note that you can only deduct losses up to the amount of your gross gambling income," Annan warns. "Any excess losses cannot be carried forward or used in subsequent years."

4. Be aware of any special rules that apply to your jurisdiction. For example, some countries treat online sports betting differently than traditional brick-and-mortar casinos. Make sure you are familiar with the relevant tax laws in order to avoid penalties and interest payments.

Annan concludes by urging taxpayers to take their taxes seriously: " Reporting your sports betting income is an important part of being a responsible citizen and fulfilling your civic duty." With these tips in mind, doing so should be much easier!

#  Follow Kofi A. Annan's Guide on How to Report Sports Betting Income

Kofi A. Annan, the former United Nations secretary-general, has urged world leaders to report their betting income and urges athletes to do the same in order to help keep the sports clean. In a recent article, he stated that “it is time for sport to rid itself of the scourge of match-fixing and corruption by coming together and taking a united stand. We must act now to protect the integrity of sport and ensure that it remains a source of joy and inspiration for all”

Annan’s guide on how to report sports betting income is a much-needed initiative in the fight against corruption in sports. The former UN secretary-general stresses the importance of full disclosure by government officials, athletes, coaches, and other individuals with knowledge of any suspicious activity related to fixing games.

Governments must take an active role in this endeavour by enacting laws that mandate disclosure and establishing an effective reporting system. Athletes must also be held accountable for their actions. They should be required to report any suspicious activities related to fixing games and must face stiff penalties if they fail to do so. Coaches and other team officials should also be required to report any suspicious activity.

The fight against corruption in sports cannot be won without the cooperation of everyone involved. Transparency is key, and we must work together to ensure that sport remains clean and entertaining for all.
