<p>As the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law that banned gambling on individual sporting events, some states are rushing to legalize online sports betting. Nevada and Delaware have already taken action and New Jersey is expected to do the same soon. This move is a boon for the gaming industry as a whole and is likely to increase revenues for state governments.</p>
<p>Online sports betting has been around for a while, but it was always in a legal grey area. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 prohibited banks and credit card companies from processing payments for online gambling, but it was never specifically targeted at sports betting. This left the door open for offshore operators to offer their services to American customers.</p>
<p>However, in May 2018 the US Supreme Court ruled that the federal ban on sports betting was unconstitutional. This gave states the authority to legalize and regulate the activity within their own borders. And that’s just what Nevada and Delaware have done.</p>
<p>In Nevada, online sports betting has been available since April 2019 through regulated operators such as William Hill and Station Casinos. These operators must use geolocation technology to verify that players are located in Nevada. Customers can place bets on sporting events from around the world, including major leagues like the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL.</p>
<p>Delaware jumped into the fray shortly after the Supreme Court ruling by issuing licenses to three casinos – namely Delaware Park, Dover Downs and Harrington Raceway &amp; Casino – which then began offering online sports betting later that month. Like Nevada, these casinos must use geolocation technology to verify players’ locations, and they can only take bets on sporting events that take place in Delaware or have strong connections to the state (such as NCAA teams).</p>
<p>New Jersey is also expected to legalize online sports betting in the near future now that its efforts to do so have been vindicated by the Supreme Court ruling. Monmouth Park Racetrack has already announced plans to offer online wagering once New Jersey’s laws are updated to reflect the new ruling. And it won’t be long before other states follow suit – West Virginia has already introduced a bill that would allow licensed casinos and racetracks to offer online sports betting.</p>
<p>The legalization of online sports betting is good news for gaming companies and state governments alike. It will provide an additional revenue stream for casinos while helping state governments collect taxes on gambling winnings. It also promises to be a popular form of entertainment, with estimations that over $6 billion will be wagered annually through legal channels once all 50 states have legalized it.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Delaware-join-other-states-in-legalizing-online-sports-betting"><a href="#Nevada-Delaware-join-other-states-in-legalizing-online-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Nevada, Delaware join other states in legalizing online sports betting"></a>Nevada, Delaware join other states in legalizing online sports betting</h1><p>Nevada and Delaware are the latest states to legalize online sports betting, following in the footsteps of New Jersey, which authorized the practice in 2013.</p>
<p>The move is a victory for fans of sports betting, who have long argued that legalizing the practice would boost tourism and tax revenue. The new laws also pave the way for other states to follow suit.</p>
<p>Both Nevada and Delaware already have robust gambling industries, with casinos and racetracks dotting the landscape. Online sports betting will now be offered through those venues, as well as via mobile apps.</p>
<p>New Jersey has seen considerable success since legalizing online sports betting. Last year, the state generated more than $180 million in tax revenue from the practice. That’s money that can be used to help fund schools, roads, and other important infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>Critics of online sports betting argue that it can lead to addiction and other social problems. But supporters say that such concerns can be addressed through regulation and education. And they note that online sports betting is already popular in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, without causing any major problems.</p>
<p>So far, nine states have legalized online sports betting. More are likely to do so in the coming years, as public opinion continues to shift in favor of the practice.</p>
<h1 id="Legal-online-sports-betting-now-available-in-Nevada-Delaware"><a href="#Legal-online-sports-betting-now-available-in-Nevada-Delaware" class="headerlink" title="Legal online sports betting now available in Nevada, Delaware"></a>Legal online sports betting now available in Nevada, Delaware</h1><p>For sports fans in Nevada and Delaware, the wait is over – legal online sports betting is now available in both states.</p>
<p>Nevada became the first state to offer legal, regulated sports betting after the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on the practice in May. Delaware followed shortly thereafter, becoming the second state to offer regulated sports betting.</p>
<p>Both states offer a wide range of betting options, including traditional bets on individual games or matchups, as well as more complex propositions such as predicting the outcome of multiple games or whether a team will cover a point spread.</p>
<p>A number of other states are expected to offer regulated sports betting in the coming months, including New Jersey, where Atlantic City’s casinos are awaiting final approval from regulators.</p>
<p>For those living in states where regulated sports betting is not yet available, there are still plenty of ways to get in on the action. Online offshore sportsbooks continue to offer a wide range of betting options for US customers, with some sites offering prop bets on nearly every game played in North America.</p>
<p>So whether you’re cheering on your favorite team at home or hitting the casino to place some bets in person, there’s never been a better time to get into sports betting!</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Delaware-expand-legal-online-sports-betting-options"><a href="#Nevada-Delaware-expand-legal-online-sports-betting-options" class="headerlink" title="Nevada, Delaware expand legal online sports betting options"></a>Nevada, Delaware expand legal online sports betting options</h1><p>The past year has seen a flurry of legal activity around the world in relation to sports betting, with new countries and states legalizing the activity. The latest such development came on Friday, when Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval signed a bill into law that allows licensed operators to offer mobile and online sports betting.</p>
<p>This follows on Delaware’s March move to legalize both in-person and online betting at its three casinos. That state’s lottery director, Wayne Parrell, said at the time that Delaware was looking to tap into new markets with its sports betting offering. “We think there are a lot of people who would like to place a bet but might not want to go to a casino or racetrack,” he said.</p>
<p>Delaware’s experience is likely to be mirrored in Nevada, as the new law there allows for mobile betting only through approved providers. This could lead to greater engagement with the sport by fans, as they will now be able to place bets from anywhere within the state’s boundaries.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether other states will follow suit in light of the recent US Supreme Court decision that struck down a federal ban on sports betting outside of Nevada. That ruling has cleared the way for states to decide for themselves whether they want to allow gambling on sporting events, so it is possible that more will move to legalize it in the coming months and years.</p>
<h1 id="Other-states-considering-legalizing-online-sports-betting-Nevada-Delaware-lead-the-way"><a href="#Other-states-considering-legalizing-online-sports-betting-Nevada-Delaware-lead-the-way" class="headerlink" title="Other states considering legalizing online sports betting; Nevada, Delaware lead the way"></a>Other states considering legalizing online sports betting; Nevada, Delaware lead the way</h1><p>As the United States Supreme Court readies to rule on a case that could legalize sports betting nationwide, lawmakers in other states are already considering allowing it within their borders.</p>
<p>In Nevada and Delaware, where sports betting is already legal, operators have seen a significant uptick in business thanks to gamblers placing bets online.</p>
<p>And now lawmakers in Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island and Michigan are all weighing bills that would legalize some form of online sports betting.</p>
<p>“It’s an inevitability that other states will follow suit if the Supreme Court rules in favor of New Jersey,” said Daniel Wallach, a gaming and sports law expert at Becker &amp; Poliakoff.</p>
<p>At the state level, the biggest obstacle for legalizing online sports betting may be opposition from powerful casino interests who want to protect their hold on the market.</p>
<p>But as more and more states legalize marijuana – another activity once reserved for black-market operators – it appears likely that online sports betting will eventually be sanctioned in at least some parts of the country.</p>
<p>For now, though, Nevada and Delaware remain the only two states where you can legally place a bet on your favorite team without having to leave home.</p>
